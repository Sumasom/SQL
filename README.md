Project: Customer Inventory Management System – Terminals Management
         This project is prototype of a real-time Customer Inventory Management System that was implemented for a very large Chemical Terminal Management company in Singapore that tracks and manages chemical storage facilities. Throughout this project, I developed the complete business workflow for contracting tanks to chemical companies, recording tank filling operations from ships, managing the two-stage truck loading process, and maintaining accurate inventory balances. This experience was particularly valuable as it allowed me to apply database concepts to solve real-world logistics challenges. I'm excited to demonstrate how I enforced business rules through programmatic constraints and maintained data integrity across complex operations—skills that I believe would transfer well to the role at your company.

From a technical perspective, I implemented 8 MySQL tables with properly defined relationships: 4 master tables (company, operation, customer, tank), 3 transaction tables (contract, tankfill, truckload), and a transaction log table. I created several stored procedures that handle critical business logic, such as InsertContract which manages contract creation with date validations, and InsertTankFill which tracks inventory with threshold checks. I'm particularly proud of my implementation of the TruckEntry and TruckExit procedures, which work together to create a two-stage loading process with automatic weight calculations. I also implemented triggers that automatically update tank balances and log entries, utilized CHECK constraints for data validation, established proper FOREIGN KEY relationships, and incorporated transaction management to prevent partial updates. For reporting, I developed several SQL queries with complex joins that provide business insights on tank utilization, customer activities, and transaction histories.
